      "p2": "With each model calculation there is a chance of over- or underestimation of the actual situation. These 2 models, for example, do not yet take into account obstacles along roads (noise barriers, closed rows of houses, etc.). For example, an underestimation can be shown for street canyons.",
      "p3": "Meanwhile, a third model (OSPM) has already been built into the model chain that better assesses air quality in narrow streets. This is already being applied to the air quality maps that show the long-term impact. But the OSPM model requires a lot of calculations and we can not apply to current air quality results for the time being. To add the OSPM result to the app, a number of technical thresholds must first be overcome.",

The concentrations measured at all government monitoring stations are added to a computer model, which also takes into account emission data (traffic, industry and shipping) and meteorological conditions (wind direction and wind speed). This computer model then calculates detailed air quality maps for the geese country. The combination of the result for nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and ozone is shown as one index in the app.",

NO2 is a good traffic-related indicator (better than particulate matter) and is one of the air pollutants that is included in the air quality index that the BelAir app shows.",

      "p5": "Acute (short-term) effects therefore occur at significantly higher concentrations. Chronic effects are the result of prolonged exposure. Compare it with smoking: a smoker will experience few acute health effects by smoking a couple of cigarettes a day. The acute effects will only occur by smoking a lot of cigarettes in a short time. But by smoking a few cigarettes every day, the risk of getting lung cancer nonetheless increases.",
